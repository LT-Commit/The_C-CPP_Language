// This is part 1.1

#include <stdio.h> // Include infomation from standard livrary

int main() // define the main function
{
    printf("Hello world!\n"); // Main calls the function printf from stdio to print "Hello world" followed by \n for new line

    return 0;
}

// Wowza first line in C very simple and from what i can tell its mostly just c++ which i do have expirence with -->
// I do know that c++ is just a OOP expansion of C right?

// Anyway a few projects from now i will probs hate myself for saying that but anyway heres why the code is running -->

// We are including a special funciton called "main" a main function needs to be in every program, just like c++ and runs the same way
// Main will usually call other functions to help preform its job.some that you wrote and some from libs you include talking about libs we have -->
// stdio.h this is just a normal library what you want to include just like iostream in c++ it includes the standard input and output library

// A sequence of charecters in quotes is called a charecter string or string constant

// For a few projects i am only going to be using charecter strings as arguments foor printf and other functions
