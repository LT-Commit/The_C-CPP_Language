    // We can alwso pass by reference into functions which i did before on day 13 this is better because it doesnt copy data46

    // The pointers we are allocating right now are in the stack so what if we want to do it in the Heap well lets do that

    char* buffer = new char[8]; // Makes a 8 byte block since a char is 1 byte , Then returns a pointer to that first stack
    memset(buffer, 0, 8); // This will set the block of data to what we want 

    std:: cout << buffer[1];


    delete[] buffer; // Delete the data when we dont use it anymore this will stop a memory leak since we are workign with the stack now
